# TakeABreak
Delphi program to encourage a computer user to take regular breaks

Configured to install into the common startup program group, this program will run minimised in the task bar, and pop up to foreground at a configured interval.
The user should then "take a break" from their desk/work.
Clicking on a "taking break" button, will start a timer, if the user wishes to time some simple exercise/s that they will then carry out.
Alternatively, or once the exercises are completed, click on the "return to work" to start the countdown timer again.
